My Experience

* Building clinical-coding LLM agents (RL post-training, production inference, synthetic data) at Swisscoding Technologies.
* Senior AI Engineer at IBM working on multimodal document AI + agentic RAG and LLM post-training (distillation / DPO).

My Projects

* [Tournament Reranker](https://github.com/PaulRoeseler/tournament-reranker) - dependency-light Python library for LLM reranking using a tournament / pyramid strategy. (Python, LLMs)
* [ORFA / IORFA — An Optimal RuleFit Algorithm](https://github.com/PaulRoeseler/An-Optimal-RuleFit-Algorithm) - optimal-tree RuleFit + single-step mixed-integer formulation. (Python, MIO, interpretability)
* [helpit](https://github.com/PaulRoeseler/helpit) - LLM-powered wrapper around Python’s `help()` that lets you ask questions about concrete objects with doc-grounded answers.

Misc

* Mostly: LLM post-training, optimization, infra for training/inference.
